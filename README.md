# Digital-Zoetrope-
Code and Design files for my Digital Zoetrope.

The Digital Zoetrope 'Zoe' has 15 @Pimoroni Badgers and I planning to spin Zoe at about 15 frames per minute (RPM).
Zoe's brains will be Raspberry Pi 4 with a Pico in a supporting role, controlling pointless LEDs, the motor and reading the RPM

Details about the Pimoroni Badgers can be found below.
